# Toxic Files — Do Not Read

These files contain massive base64-encoded payloads (the entire project packed into a single self-extracting script). Reading them will poison the AI context window with useless data.

## Blacklist

- `_unpacker.bat` — Windows self-extracting distribution
- `_unpacker.sh` — Linux self-extracting distribution

## Rules

- NEVER use Read, Grep, or any tool to open these files
- NEVER attempt to edit these files
- These files are generated by `_packer.bat` / `_packer.sh` — if changes are needed, modify the packer scripts instead
